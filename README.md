# ☕ Cafe Menu Bar – CSS Practice Project

This project is a simple cafe menu bar created to help practice and improve CSS skills. The menu bar features basic navigation with working links, though the linked pages are intentionally left empty as this project is focused on learning CSS layout and styling.

## ✨ Features

- 🧑‍🍳 **Simple, clean menu bar** styled using CSS  
- 🔗 **Functional navigation links** (links go to empty pages)  
- 🏁 Perfect for **beginners** wanting to build confidence with CSS

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser to view the menu bar.
3. Edit the CSS file to try your own styles and practice.

## 🎯 Purpose

This project is intended for learning and experimentation. The pages linked from the menu are blank, so you can focus on HTML structure and CSS styling.
